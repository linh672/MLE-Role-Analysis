# Introduction
ðŸ“Š This project presents a Python-based data analysis of job postings in the United States, with a specific focus on Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) roles. Using tools such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib, the analysis explores key aspects of the MLE job market, including the most in-demand skills and salary distributions. The goal is to uncover patterns that help aspiring MLEs and industry professionals better understand employer expectations, prevalent technologies, and opportunities across the US. Through data visualization and exploratory analysis, the project offers actionable insights into one of the most rapidly growing tech careers today.

# Python Skills Used

- Data Cleaning with pandas (handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib
- Data Visualization (scatter plots, bar charts, custom annotations)
- Grouping and Aggregation (using `groupby`, `agg`, `pivot_table`)
- String and text processing (e.g., parsing dictionaries from stringified columns)
- Working with `ast.literal_eval`
- Sorting and filtering data for insights
- Labeling and annotating plots with `adjustText`
- Formatting axes and customizing plots with matplotlib
- Basic use of Python control structures and dictionary operations


# The analysis
### 1. What insights can we uncover from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

### 2. What are the most common skills required for data-related jobs in the USA?

### 3. Which skills was trending for Machine Learning Engineers in the USA?

### 4. What does the salary distribution look like for Machine Learning Engineers in the USA?

### 5. Which skills are the most optimal for maximizing salary as a Machine Learning Engineer in the USA?
